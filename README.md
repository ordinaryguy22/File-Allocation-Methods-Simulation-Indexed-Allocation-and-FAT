# File-Allocation-Methods-Simulation-Indexed-Allocation-and-FAT

he project aims to simulate two different file allocation methods: Indexed Allocation and File  Allocation Table (FAT). The simulation is implemented using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical  user interface (GUI). The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how files are allocated and  managed in operating systems using these two allocation methods.
